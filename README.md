# LimitedBits

## What is LimitedBits
LimitedBits is a social media platform built to provide users with a stream of short, high quality, and informative content. Users are only allowed to make 1 post per week - in order to ensure high quality posting.

## Challanges Faced
The biggest challenge I faced when building LimitedBits is that I had never used the MERN stack before. Actually, I had never developed any sort of backend before - typically I use Firebase. However, I have taken courses on the MERN stack in the past, so I figured this project would be a great way for me to test myself and advance my skillset. 

## Technologies Used
For this project I decided to use the MERN stack for the frontend and backend, along with some other technologies to aid in the frontend development.
- MongoDB
- Express
- ReactJS
- NodeJS
- TypeScript
- HTML/CSS
